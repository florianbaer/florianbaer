### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on school projects for the Ethereum Blockchain, NLP with Scikit-Learn, GC with WebGL (not even basic skills) - so lots of python and javascript...
- :hammer: For the company i work with K8s, Angular, RxJS, .NET 5, PostgreSQL
- :whale: CKA: Certified Kubernetes Administrator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently on a bsc in my final year. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI/ML projects (preferred after my bsc thesis...)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. It's possible that you wont get an answer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me *not*: Like these lazy LinkedIn Recruiters... This is so sad what you do everyday. I'm not a senior java dev (even though i would like it as well), i'm not a woman (please write at least Mr. instead of Mrs... - should be easy to lookup)
