### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on school projects for the Ethereum Blockchain, NLP with Scikit-Learn, GC with WebGL (not even basic skills) - so lots of python and javascript...
- :hammer: For the company i work with K8s, Angular, RxJS, .NET 5, PostgreSQL
- :whale: CKA: [Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/b70fad82-80f7-4fd8-b769-d0c3fa9f53ee/linked_in)
- 🌱 I’m currently on a bsc in my final year. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI/ML projects
- 💬 Ask me about anything. It's possible that you wont get an answer.
- 📫 How to reach me *not*: Like these lazy LinkedIn Recruiters... This is so sad what you do everyday. I'm not a senior java dev (even though i would like it as well), i'm not a woman (please write at least Mr. instead of Mrs... - should be easy to lookup)
